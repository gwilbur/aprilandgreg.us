If you don't have a passport, or your passport expires before May 2017 (Mexico
requires six months minimum validity for entry), it would be best to apply for
one or for renewal soon. Processing can take as much as 8 weeks plus mailing
time, and in some cases can take multiple attempts. Everything you need for
this process should be available here:
