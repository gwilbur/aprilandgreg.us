Here are some tips from us to you so you can best enjoy your time at Iberostar

- There are four specialty restaurants that you can have your concierge make
  reservations for.  We suggest that you request making these reservations when
  you arrive since they can fill up:
    - Venezia Italian Restaurant
    - Latelier Gourmet Restarant (French)
    - Toni's Surf & Turf Restaurant
    - Haiku Japanese Restaurant (we will be having our welcome dinner here on
      Friday at 8:30 already)

- Make sure men bring long pants for specialty restaurants.

- Room service breakfast is not as good as breakfast at Bella Vista Buffet
  Restaurant.  They are open from 7:00 AM to 11:30 AM.

- Check out lunch by the pool.  We have had grilled lobsters, steak and seafood
  paella there.

- There are nightly shows at the theater.

- Catamaran, kayak, introduction to diving in the pool, snorkeling and water
  polo are all included in your stay.

- Other water sports are available at special prices.  (banana boat, boat
  trips, jet-skiing, parasailing, sailing lessons, water skiing and
  windsurfing)

- There are some places to check out at the neighboring resort, the Iberostar
  Paraiso Maya, which is accessible to anyone staying with us at the Grand Hotel.
    - Wave Pool
    - Water Park
    - Lazy River
    - In the lobby there is an area where you can book tours.
