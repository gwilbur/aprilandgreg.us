Welcome to the [Iberostar Grand Hotel Paraiso](http://www.thegrandcollection.com/en/hotels/riviera-maya/iberostar-grand-hotel-paraiso/introduction)
in beautiful Playa del Carmen, Mexico! We recently spent four nights here to
celebrate our engagement and we liked it so much we decided to get married
there! Here's some information about the resort:

> With an impressive neo-classic design, this fine adults-only resort in
Riviera Maya is designed to fulfill your every need and exceed your every
expectation. From your luxurious suite with concierge and butler service, to
the highly trained professional staff, the all-inclusive 24-hour service will
cater to your every whim.

> There are three pools onsite - a lake pool with swim-up bar, a quiet pool and
a heated indoor/outdoor pool with retractable roof. Other hotel amenities
include shops, a beauty salon and a spa specializing in couples' treatments and
massages. In addition, guests enjoy full access to all neighboring hotels in
the Iberostar Playa Paraiso complex and El Spa (located at the Shopping
Center).

Here are some pictures from our recent visit *(THIS COULD BE YOU!)*:

If, for some reason, spending all day by the swim-up bar drinking mojitos isn't
enough for you, there are plenty of things to do off the resort as well.

There is also a shuttle at the resort that will take you to downtown Playa del
Carmen, which is about 20 minutes away. If any of you are still deciding
whether you can make it, feel free to reach out to us with any questions and
we'll do our best to answer them.
