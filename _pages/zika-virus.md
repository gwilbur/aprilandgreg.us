The Zika Virus has been in the news a lot lately, and as our knowledge of it
expands, here are a few good sources of information about it:

- [http://www.cdc.gov/zika](http://www.cdc.gov/zika/)
- [http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/zika-virus-mexico](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/zika-virus-mexico)
- [http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/en/](http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/en/)

There's certainly a ton of information there and elswhere, so here's a quick
introduction:

- The symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. These
  are usually mild and can last up to a week.
- Zika is primarily transmitted through mosquito bites, and can also be
  sexually transmitted by men.
- It has been confirmed that pregnant mothers that are infected can transfer
  the virus to their fetus.
- A significant correlation has been found between Zika and certain birth
  defects, such as microcphaly.

Now this may all sound very ominous, but rest assured, this will have no effect
on our wedding. As long as the situation doesn't get much worse, we're going to
be there having the time of our lives, and we would love for you to join us.
Still, if you feel that you can't risk your health, we will miss you, but we
understand if you can't make it.
