November 8th is Election Day in the US, so if you plan on voting this year, you
should either make sure you are back in time to be present, or vote by absentee
ballot. For New York residents, the form is available
[http://www.elections.ny.gov/VotingAbsentee.html](here). Californians, you can
go [http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/vote-mail/](here).
Everyone else, you're on your own ([http://www.longdistancevoter.org/](this)
might help though)
