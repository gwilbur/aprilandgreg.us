To give you guys an idea of the different options available at the hotel,
here's a list of all the rooms and how much they will cost. If you responded to
our form, we reserved the base level suite for you for the dates that you
specified. If you feel like you want to ball out and upgrade to something
fancier, that is not a problem at all.

All room types come with all the food you can eat and all the booze you can
drink as well as the following:

> Private Balcony, air conditioning, ceiling fan, customizable minibar (stocked
daily with premium liquors, international and domestic beer, soft drinks,
bottled water and snacks), 24 hour gourmet room service, Concierge and butler
service, flat screen TV, alarm clock, iPod/MP3 docking station, DVD and CD
player, digital safe, coffee maker, iron and ironing board, hair dryer, fine
European bed linens and luxurious amenities with pillow menu, aromatherapy,
bathrobes, slippers and daily turndown service. Marble bathrooms with double
vanity sink, shower and separate whirlpool tub. Total area is 646 square feet.
Complimentary access to Spa Sensations wet area and complimentary WiFi.
Bedding: 1 king bed or 2 double beds.

The main difference between the rooms is their locations:

- Superior Suite: Priority location in main building on upper floor, near restaurants.
- Poolview Suite: Located in Main Building with view of the quiet pool.
- Oceanfront Suite: Beachfront location on ground level or first floor.
- Superior Oceanfront Suite: Priority oceanfront location on top floor near beach and main pool.

Here are the prices for all types. Prices are per-person, so the total for
two-person rates will be double what is listed.
