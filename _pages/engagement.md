June 19th started out as a normal day for them. They woke up together (after
two snoozes, as usual), they got ready together and they left for work
together. They kissed goodbye for the day in the middle of Grand Central where
so much of their early relationship took place, but now simply exists as the
point where their two commutes diverge. April thought that Greg was on his way
to work, but in reality he would spend the day preparing for a moment that
would change both their lives forever.

After an important phone call to ask April's Mother for her blessing, Greg got
to work setting the scene. Their good friend, Mike, was gracious enough to
supply his apartment's rooftop with a beautiful view of downtown New York as a
setting. A few lights and scattered rose petals later and it was ready.

While they enjoyed a nice dinner together and April still suspecting nothing,
Mike helped send some last minute invites out to their friends to help them
celebrate their special moment. Greg used their presence to convince April to
head to Mike's after dinner "just to hang out for a bit." Once they got there,
she understood Greg's real plan and she was speechless.

Greg got down on one knee, told April that meeting her had changed his life in
ways he couldn't have imagined, that she had made him so happy and that he
wanted to continue that happiness for the rest of their lives. He then reached
into his pocket, produced a diamond ring and asked her if she would agree to
marry him. April wanted to shout, "YES!", but the most she could muster was a
vigorous nod while barely holding back joyous tears. The moment was punctuated
by cheers from their friends nearby, from strangers on the street and from
surrounding buildings.

We would like to thank everyone who came and everyone who sent their
congratulations. We'd especially like to thank Mike for letting us trash his
roof in the name of love and Ben for the excellent photography.

Stay tuned for updates on the wedding and whatever else we decide to put up
here. Thanks for reading!
